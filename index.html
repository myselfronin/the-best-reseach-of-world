    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Software integration from kitchens to cars, for the benefit of human civilization, is advancing at a rapid rate.
      One can find software in virtually everything used in daily life. The field has stretched itself eminently by 
      changing the way we govern, gain education, manage health, organize businesses, and so on. This means a huge
      amount of software has and is being developed every day. Along with the growth, the complexity of software 
      products has also increased remarkably. The development process has become vulnerable to missing deadlines, 
      low quality, cost overruns, and so on. Such problems or challenges must be overcome so as to prosper the whole 
      field of software engineering toward a better future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with the intricacy of software, the optimization of software phenomena or even finding effective ones has
      become a challenging task. Nevertheless, it is crucial for companies or organizations to continuously improve 
      their software process in order to deliver high-quality software within a specified timeframe, budget, and with 
      available resources. It is obligatory for companies or organizations to continuously improve their  
      development tools or techniques, in order to deliver high-quality software within a specified timeframe, budget, and with available 
      resources. Thus, a systematic and disciplined approach to improving the such phenomena is needed.
    <p>
      This paper highlights methods that can be used to perform an evaluation in software engineering, mostly the empirical 
      research methods. A detailed description about three different approaches to empirical studies, namely, quantitative, 
      qualitative, and mixed methods have been discussed. Also, it presents the findings of performing surveys and interviews 
      for evaluation of the code review process.

    <h2>2. Empirical Software Engineering Evaluation</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Scientific methods should be used to influence software development. Glass<a href="#r1" class="reference">[1]</a>, 
      has summarized four methods for research in the field of software engineering i.e. <i>Scientific Method</i>,  <i>Engineering Method</i>,
      <i>Empirical Method</i> and  <i>Analytical Method</i>.
      Although other methods are also necessary for software engineering, the focus of this paper is on <strong>Empirical Method.</strong>
      Software engineering is driven by the professionals involved in software development. In order to 
      evaluate the software phenomena, there needs a study on how software practitioners solve software problems ie 
      discover their instincts or experience on the topic under discussion. Such phenomena can be processes, 
      tools, techniques, policies, practices, and so on, used for developing software. Evaluating such phenomena using 
      empirical strategies can be termed Empirical Evaluation in Software Engineering.
    </p>
    <h3>2.2 Empirical Strategies</h3>
    <p>
      Exploratory and Explanatory are two paradigms in empirical studies<a href="#r2">[2]</a>.  Exploratory is concerned with understanding 
      the point of view and discovering the notices of the subject. The subject would mean the person participating in the 
      empirical studies for evaluating an object. These are informed by the qualitative data. On the other hand, 
      Explanatory is concerned with comparing two or more groups to identify cause-effect relationships. As this is informed 
      by quantitative data, one can perform comparison and statistical analysis on them. Both quantitative and qualitative 
      research investigations can be implemented on the same topic. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The survey, case study, and experiment are the major types of strategies, depending upon the purpose of the evaluation, 
      whether it is techniques, methods, or tools, and depending on the conditions for the empirical investigation. 
      Depending on the purpose of evaluation, may that be for techniques, methods, or tools, and also depending on 
      conditions for empirical investigations, there are three major strategies [114].
    </p>
    <h4>2.2.1 Survey</h4>
    <p>
      A survey is one of the best-known methods of collecting data from a large number of target people. It is generally 
      used for investing already in used tools or techniques and aims to generalize the findings. This empirical method 
      can be used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data and derive explanatory and exploratory conclusions. 
      Interviews and questionnaires are the primary means of collecting data.[wholin book]
    </p>
    <h4>2.2.2 Case Study</h4>
    <p>
      A case study is an empirical inquiry that uses a variety of sources of data to examine one or a few instances of 
      software phenomena in its real context. It can be used to assess which of the two methods is more suited in a certain 
      context. Research published in 2009, shows that case studies are the most frequently used evaluating technique
      in computer science [Taxanomy one].
    </p>
    <h4>2.2.1 Experiment</h4>
    <p>
      An experiment is an empirical inquiry in which one can manipulate certain factors or variables in order to study 
      the change in the final outcome. Experiment can be human-oriented in which humans apply different treatments to objects 
      or technology-oriented where different tools are applied to different objects.

    <h2>Interview</h2>
    We collected qualitative data via interviews. There were 5 interviewees in total. The interview was conducted 
    using computer-mediated communication, specifically Zoom. Following are the series of questions asked to our interviewees.
    <figure>
      <pre>

- What do you think code review is?
- Do you believe that code review helps you expand your knowledge?
- What tool or methods are you familiar with for code review? And which one 
  do you suggest to be used more often?
- Do you believe code review shortens the development time in the long term?
- How can we make the code review process more effective?
      </pre>
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Listing 1</strong>: Interview Questions
      </figcaption>
    <p>
      The first question was to know if their understanding of the code review process and our research topic matches. 
      All of them had similar answers from which we took keywords and presented them in the word cloud in <a href="#wc1">Figure 1</a>. 
      Also, everyone agreed that the process helps them expand their skills. For the mid-level developer, it was helpful
      because the senior's guidance could make their code quality better. For seniors, it was more about witnessing different
      perspective of developing solutions to the same problem.

    <p>
      For daily use, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> was the most popular tool for reviewing codes, among them.
      Whereas, <a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> was suggested as automated tool which could help in 
      the code review process for making it more effective.Some other tools that was mentioned in the interview are in <a href="#wc2">Figure 2</a>.
      One interviewee suggested splitting issues into small cards within GitLab would help in reviewing code for other 
      developers and make it easier to modify codes. Another interviewee even claimed that 
      this automated tool helped shortens the time for the review process.

        <strong>Figure 1</strong>: Code Review Tools
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>We asked if they agree that the code review process shortens time in long run even its time consuming at beginning. 
      We got mixed ansers on this. Some said that it is or should (if not) already be in planning of the development. 
      Hence the review is not a factor for time constraint but rather a standard process for quality code. 
      Other agreed on the propsed statement saying that the possible bug are already detected to it save the struggle 
      and time for fixing it. Apart from the tools, pair programming was also advised to be 
      a method that would increase the productivity. One interviewee suggested to skip the minor fixes and focus 
      more into the bigger picture (on security vulnerabilities, memory leakage, redability, etc).

    <h2>1. Three Research Approaches</h2>
    <p>
      In this paper, we are going to go deeper into three research approaches:
      quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. Mostly, quantitative and
      qualitative approaches are seen as opposite sides or distinct
      categories. Instead, they represent different ends of a continuity so a
      study can be more quantitative in some aspects than qualitative or the
      other way. For some cases, a mixed method research is needed to
      incorporate elements of both quantitative and qualitative. [todo page 41
      first paragraph]
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, quantitative and qualitative research are differentiated
      by the idea that quantitative research uses numbers instead of words
      used by qualitative research or that quantitative research uses
      closed-ended questions and qualitative research uses open-ended
      questions. This is indeed true but a more complete way to see the
      differences between these two approaches is to look at the types of
      research strategies used(e.g, surveys, experiments, interviews),
      philosophical assumptions brought by the researcher and the method or
      tools used to conduct these approaches (e.g., instruments used to
      collect quantitative data or observations used to collect qualitative
      data). Quantitative research has dominated the research approaches from
      the late 19th to mid-20th century. After that period of time, the
      interest for qualitative research approaches increased, thus growing the
      interest for mixed research methods. [todo page 41 second paragraph]
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>2 Quantitative Method</h2>
    <p>
      Quantitative research approach uses objective theories and tests them by
      analyzing different variables and the relationship between them. These
      kinds of variables are measured using instruments so numerical data can
      be collected and used to produce statistical results. The researcher in
      this approach builds the research against the bias, eliminates or
      controls new nuances of explanations and findings, and builds a research
      that can be replicated and generalized. [todo page 41]
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quantitative approach, the researcher avoids the variation during
      the introduction of the topic since the objective is to what factors and
      variables influence an outcome and not to generate new ideas or
      solutions based on the participants perspective. For example,
      quantitative research can be conducted to understand if the financial
      issues contribute to a divorce. In this case, the variables and factors
      help the research to understand and explain this particular problem. The
      quantitative research introduction should not be written and affected by
      the personal view of the researcher in order to support objectivity.
      [todo page 162]
    </p>
    <h3>2.1 Quantitative Methodologies</h3>
    <p>
      The researcher, despite the fact that has to choose between the
      quantitative, qualitative and mixed research approach, also decides on
      what type of design to choose within these approaches. Research methodologies
      are different kinds of inquiry that provide instructions and direction
      for procedures to be followed in a study. These types of design have
      grown dramatically over the years since the advances made in technology
      and tools to collect and analyze complex data. [todo page 49]
    </p>
    <h4>2.1.1 Field experiments</h4>
    <p>
      Field experiments are conducted in actual environments. To test the effect, one or more factors must be isolated
      and
      changed. Although there are many more variables to take into account, it enables the researcher to witness more
      natural behavior. This method is also frequently used in applied sciences like bioengineering and medicine as well
      as sociology.
      When contrasted to lab tests, field experiments provide a number of advantages. It provides a setting that is more
      similar to nature than a lab. It is appropriate to examine large groups of people since they tend to be more
      representative. On the other side, controlling variables is more complicated, making it very difficult to
      reproduce the same conditions. Furthermore, because it is challenging to manage the environment, unforeseen events
      may occur and have a negative impact on patients and participants. [todo papger page 380]
    </p>
    <h4>2.1.2 Surveys</h4>
    <p>
      A survey is a research method that enables the direct gathering of data from a participant in the study using a
      series of questions arranged in a certain order. It is one of the most popular quantitative techniques because it
      enables the gathering of data on a particular topic by asking questions that capture the attitudes, perceptions,
      and actions of a group of people.
      Surveys have a number of advantages. The high population representativeness and the method's inexpensive cost in
      comparison to other options are two of its most significant advantages. On the other hand, the survey's design and
      the respondents' accuracy of response depend greatly on the validity of the data. [todo paper page 381]
    </p>
    <h4>2.1.3 Correlation study</h4>
    <p>
      In essence, correlational research is an experimental technique used to examine if there is a correlation between
      two or more variables. There is merely an examination of how closely the variables are related; there is no
      manipulation of the variables. A correlational analysis emphasizes two characteristics: the relationship's
      strength and direction. We can quickly quantify observational data by looking at the correlation coefficient. At
      the same time, we can gather a variety of data from numerous domains at once and investigate the relationships
      between those variables. The link between two variables could perhaps be explained by a third variable, hence
      correlation does not imply causality. [todo paper page 381]
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>3. Qualitative Method</h2>
    <p>
      Qualitative research approach is used for understanding the perspective
      of individuals and their experience on a social problem and exploring a
      topic for different nuances. The process of conducting this kind of
      research approach involves data collected from participants in different
      life situations and experience which is represented by the
      interpretation of the researcher. The focus is on the individual meaning
      rather than numbers and statistics. [todo page 41]
    </p>
    <p>
      In a qualitative approach, the problem that the researcher describes can
      be understood by exploring a topic and comprehending new variations
      given by the participants. Qualitative research problem has some
      characteristics: the topic has a lack of previous research and theory
      which may be incorrect, inaccurate or biased; the topic needs to be
      developed further; a quantitative approach is not suitable for this kind
      of problem. In a qualitative approach, the researcher should rely on the
      participant's perspective and may begin the introduction of the problem
      with a personal opinion or experience from the researcher in order to
      focus on the subjective point of view. [todo page 162]
    </p>
    <h3>3.1 Qualitative Methodologies</h3>
    <p>
      In qualitative approaches, the design types became more visible and
      clear during the 1990s. The origins for these approaches come from
      sociology, humanities, and evaluation. There are many methodologies and design types for qualitative research but
      we will focus on observations, ethnography and structured interviews and show their strengths and weaknesses. [
      todo page 50]
    </p>
    <h4>3.1.1 Observation</h4>
    <p>
      Researchers examine a specific phenomena in its natural setting as part
      of a systematic method for gathering information called observation.
      This approach is particularly recommended when a subject is largely
      unknown and it is crucial to fully comprehend a phenomenon while
      preserving the surrounding circumstances. Observation is a useful method
      for gathering information concurrently with the occurrence of the event
      without interfering with it. It is a discrete, highly adaptable strategy
      that is focused on knowledge discovery. In some circumstances, such as
      the study of human and animal behavior, trustworthy data collection is
      the only option. On the other hand, it is a very time-consuming strategy
      that needs advance planning and the researcher's availability to travel
      to the location where the event occurs. Additionally, since the
      researcher is the only one who interprets the data, the method is
      extremely sensitive to the independence of the analysis. [todo paper
      page 376]
    </p>
    <h4>3.1.2 Ethnography</h3>
      <p>
        In ethnography, people are interviewed after being observed in a
        circumstance. In an ethnographic study, the researcher makes an effort
        to understand the scenario being observed from the participants' points
        of view. There are two fundamental elements of ethnography: (i) the
        observation occurs in a natural context, and (ii) researchers must
        comprehend how an event is experienced and processed by members of a
        speech community. The methodologies of observation and ethnography are
        extremely similar. However, when doing an ethnographic study, the
        researcher must adopt a more comprehensive perspective and pay close
        attention to every detail.[todo paper
        page 376]
      </p>
      <p>
        The main benefit of ethnography is that it allows the researcher to gain
        a thorough understanding of the issue under study. However, ethnography
        involves a significant time commitment from the researcher, and because
        the study's findings can be so varied, it can be challenging to draw
        accurate and focused conclusions.
      </p>
      <h4>3.1.3 Structured Interviews</h4>
      <p>
        Structured interviews are a type of assessment tool used to collect and compare interviewee replies. The
        interviewee
        is questioned about prior encounters and/or suggested fictitious settings. All interviewees go through the same
        procedure. High response rates are normal for structured interviews, and the interviewer is present to explain
        the
        question to prevent respondents from misinterpreting it. A systematic interview might take time to prepare,
        though.
        Additionally, even if during the interview new lines of study sound fascinating to pursue, they do not have the
        same
        flexibility in the choice of the responses that are predefined and cannot be changed by the researcher.[todo
        paper
        page 377]
      </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>4. Mixed Method</h2>
    <p>
      Mixed method research approach is used to investigate topics that need
      to collect both qualitative and quantitative data and to integrate these
      data to come to fully described conclusions supported by both types of
      data. The main objective of this approach is to give additional insight
      for a topic that cannot be given by either quantitative or qualitative
      data alone. [todo page 41-42]
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to write the introduction for a mixed method study, the
      researcher can either put an emphasis on the quantitative or qualitative
      approach and maybe some combination of both. This emphasis will be shown
      in the introduction of the study. For studies that need to have an equal
      emphasis on quantitative and qualitative, there is a necessity to
      understand the topic in both quantitative and qualitative data in order
      to show the relationship between variables and explore the topic in
      detail. A mixed method approach can be primarily quantitative or
      qualitative when there is a need to make the study more diverse in terms
      of methodologies and to be more inclusive. For example, a primarily
      quantitative research may need to explain the relationship between
      smoking behavior and depression and then dive deep into the detailed
      views and perspectives of these participants. [todo page 163]
    </p>
    <h3>4.1 Mixed Method Methodologies</h3>
    <p>
      Mixed methods combine quantitative and qualitative research and the data
      collected from both of them. Quantitative data contain close-ended
      responses from participants found on questionnaires and surveys while
      qualitative data contains open-ended responses which can result in
      different nuances of the topic. Both of these methods have their
      weaknesses and bias so the collection of them will result in
      neutralizing these weaknesses by supporting each other. Some of the best
      ways to use these two types of data are: (a) the validity of a database
      can be checked or verified by the other database; (b) one database can
      explain the findings of the other database; (c) one database can use the
      other database and build on that.[todo page 51]
    </p>
    <p>
      Convergent mixed methods is a design type where the researcher collects
      both forms of data at the same time and merges the information to
      analyze it and interpret it as a whole. If there is any contradiction or
      conflict while integrating the data, they are explained by the
      researcher.[todo page 52]
    </p>
    <p>
      Explanatory sequential mixed methods is a design type in which the
      researcher conducts the quantitative session and then the qualitative
      one. The quantitative data are analyzed and the findings are explained
      by the qualitative responses. This design is explanatory because the
      quantitative data are explained by qualitative data and it is called
      sequential because the two types of research are conducted one after the
      other. This design is used mostly in topics with a strong quantitative
      direction where the quantitative results need to be further explored by
      qualitative data.[todo page 52]
    </p>
    <p>
      Exploratory sequential mixed methods is the opposite of the explanatory.
      The qualitative research is conducted first in order to get the
      participants' views and analyze them. With this information, the
      researcher can choose the perfect instrument to conduct the quantitative
      part. The analyzed data allows the researcher to check for appropriate
      instruments and find the variables that need to go into the quantitative
      session.[todo page 52]
    </p>
    <h2>5 Demo</h2>
    <p>
      In this research, we are conducting a quantitative and qualitative method about the code review process. Code
      review is an important process for software evaluation and improvement nowadays. This process is relatively new
      and some more insight is needed on what developers think about this process by conducting interviews for the
      qualitative part. In order to support this data, we conducted surveys and analyzed the results to provide some
      statistical information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hypothesis of this evaluation is that the code review process is extremely important so we need to prove
      this
      by quantitative data and also get some detailed responses and experiences from professionals related to the
      software industry. We also want to find what tools and methods are more common in the code review process.
      The qualitative session will also provide us with different nuances of what code review process means from the
      participants’ perspective.
    </p>
    <h3>5.1 Audience</h3>
    <p>
      We are focusing our research on professionals in the software industry with different levels of experience,
      from
      junior to senior. This allows us to see how the code review process is perceived by someone who is just
      starting
      in the software world and how it can evolve as a concept during the experience growth. Another important point
      to
      investigate is to relate the importance of the code review process with experience, this shows how this
      process is
      presented to the juniors and if the importance is increased or decreased throughout the years.
    </p>
    <h3>5.2 Questions of Survey</h3>
    <p>
      Q1: Have you ever involved yourself in a code inspection to find common vulnerabilities, possible
      performance
      issues, possible code improvements and improve coding style?
    </p>
    <p>
      Q2: Has this process helped you improve the code quality?
    </p>
    <p>
      Q3: What type of code review process have you used?
    </p>
    <p>
      Q4: If you have a working code, will you use code review for performance improvement and implement the
      changes
      afterwards even if the deadline has almost passed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Q5: Have you ever reviewed the code of your colleagues or vice versa? If yes, how effective did you find
      peer code
      review?
    </p>
    <p>
      Q6: Have you ever used automated code review tools? (For example: plugins in IDE like ESLint, softwares like
      SonarQube)? If yes, how effective did you find automated code review?
    </p>
    <p>
      Q7: After the code review, some coders find themselves investing a few minutes to some hours of additional
      time,
      whereas others find investing more time than it had taken them to program before the review. In scale of
      percentage how much time have you found yourself investing (generally) for modification of your work? Note
      100% is
      the total time taken for you to come up with a workable solution. (Note 100% = total time taken to complete
      the
      feature)
    </p>
    <p>
      Q8: If implementing the code review changes takes more than the time needed to implement the new feature, we
      can
      say that the code review process is not effective. How much time do you think code review changes should
      take in
      order to be effective? (Note 100% = total time taken to complete the feature)
    </p>
    <p>
      We start the survey with the question that asks the participants if they have ever been part of the code
      review.
      This questions’ objective is to give more insight into the code review process so the participants’ will
      have a
      clear idea of what this process is (Q1). The questions Q2 - Q4 are used to get an idea of how important do
      the
      participants think that code review process is and check if they find it as a critical process or not (Q4).
    </p>
    <p>
      We ask the participants if they have ever used peer review or automated review and see how effective they
      find it
      (Q5 and Q6). These questions are used to compare the two most used code review types and fulfill one of our
      objectives to see which tools and methods are most common in the code review process.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Q7, we ask participants how much time it takes to implement the changes after a code review session. Our
      intention with this question is to indirectly see how important and serious is the code review process
      because if
      it takes a huge amount of time then it means that this process is used for serious purposes not only for
      best
      coding practices and styles.
    </p>
    <p>We included a biased question (Q8) to see if the participants have a clear understanding of the importance
      of
      code review or not. We say that if the code review changes take up a lot of time, then the code review
      process is
      not effective and then we ask them to give a reasonable time range. If they give a high range then we can
      say that
      the code review process is seen as extremely important by the developers.</p>
