    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Software integration from kitchens to cars, for the benefit of human civilization, is advancing at a rapid rate. One can find software 
      in virtually everything used in daily life. The field has stretched itself eminently by changing the way we govern, gain education, 
      manage health, organize businesses, and so on. This means a huge amount of software has and is being developed every day. Along with 
      the growth, the complexity of software products has also increased remarkably. The development process has become vulnerable to 
      missing deadlines, low quality, cost overruns, and so on. Such problems or challenges must be overcome so as to prosper the whole 
      field of software engineering toward a better future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with the intricacy of software, the optimization of software phenomena or even finding effective ones has become a challenging task. 
      Nevertheless, it is crucial for companies or organizations to continuously improve their software process in order to deliver high-quality 
      software within a specified timeframe, budget, and with available resources. A systematic and disciplined approach to improving such 
      phenomena is needed. Additionally, thousands of research for the sake of improvement are proposed but most of them lack or have low quality 
      for validation. Such proposals can be evaluated using empirical methods which are best suited as the practitioner's perspective is the solid 
      acceptance of proposed improvements.
    <p>
      This paper highlights the major empirical methods that can be used to perform an evaluation in software engineering. It also features the 
      advantages and disadvantages of those methods. Also, we have discussed some of the importance of evaluation in software engineering in the 
      later section before presenting a demonstration of our findings on performing surveys and interviews as strategies for those methods.

    <h2>2. Empirical Software Engineering Evaluation</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Overview</h3>
    <p>
      One of the pioneers of the SE research community, Robert Glass<a href="#r1">[1]</a> has summarized four methods for research in the field of software engineering 
      i.e. Scientific Method, Engineering Method, Empirical Method, and Analytical Method. In Scientific Method, the world is observed and a model is 
      built on which the research object is evaluated; Engineering Method is about proposing changes to current solutions and then evaluating them;
       Analytical Method is used when a formal theory is proposed and is compared with empirical observation; in Empirical Method a model is evaluated 
       empirically.
      <p> 
      Although other methods are also necessary for software engineering, the focus of this paper is on <strong>Empirical Methods.</strong>
      Software engineering is driven by the professionals involved in software development. In order to
      evaluate the software phenomena, there needs a study on how software practitioners solve software problems ie
      discover their instincts or experience on the topic under discussion. Such phenomena can be processes,
      tools, techniques, policies, practices, and so on, used for developing software. Evaluating such phenomena using
      empirical strategies can be termed Empirical Evaluation in Software Engineering.
      </p>
    </p>
    <h3>2.2 Empirical Methods</h3>
    <p>
      Qualitative and Quantitative are two main types of research paradigms in empirical studies[2]. Qualitative is concerned with understanding 
      the point of view and discovering the notices of the subject. The subject would mean the person participating in the empirical studies for 
      evaluating an object. These are informed by the qualitative data. On the other hand, Quantitative is concerned with comparing two or more 
      groups to identify cause-effect relationships. As this is informed by quantitative data, one can perform comparison and statistical analysis 
      on them. Both quantitative and qualitative research investigations can be implemented on the same topic. However, instead of being opposite 
      poles, these method represents the different end of a continuum<a href="#r4">[ Newman & Benz, 1998]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, these two research are differentiated by closed-ended questions and responses, giving us a numerical result (quantitative) 
      or open-ended questions and responses resulting in answers in words (qualitative) [Green book]. For example, when evaluating the code review 
      process, one can ask about its effectiveness which gives answers on a range scale (i.e numbers). Whereas, others can inquire about ways to 
      make the code review process more effective. The formal question is a part of quantitative research and the latter is for qualitative research. 
      But a complete way to see the difference between these two is to look at the basic assumptions, the types of research strategies used, and the 
      method for conducting those strategies.[Green book]. A study can be more quantitative and less qualitative in some and for others, it is vice-versa.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>3. Importance of Evaluation in Research Process</h2>
    <p>
      In order to assess the validity of techniques or methods, evaluation of such a proposal is critical. If proper evidence or proof of new or 
      improvised conventions is available then the software practitioner would get more confidence in using them. It enables us to set standards 
      in working with a common problem and drive the software space more scientifically. Rather than a random instinct or guess for developing 
      solutions, we should use scientifically validated methodologies which leads to a systematic improvement of the whole process. The need for 
      the usage of empirically evaluated engineering is more essential for us than ever because of the fast-growing and challenging software industry. 
      Our decision for utilizing certain tools or processes is driven by the evaluation present when such tools or processes are proposed. This not 
      only contributes to methodical improvement but the overall enhancement of software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the condition of evalution in research within computer science or software engineering is not satisfactory. Additionally, the software
      practitioners themselves are not looking for validity of the new ways propsed in this research area. Some critics have even said that: "SE research suffers
      from irrelevance. Research outputs have little relevance to software practice."[Tan ang Tang 2019].
      A half century of development of this industry, the scientific development is still lacking. A study on evaluation in computer science published 
      by ACM in two different time i.e 1995 and 2008, was done.

    <h2>2 Quantitative Method</h2>
    <p>
      Quantitative research approach uses objective theories and tests them by
      analyzing different variables and the relationship between them. These
      kinds of variables are measured using instruments so numerical data can
      be collected and used to produce statistical results. The researcher in
      this approach builds the research against the bias, eliminates or
      controls new nuances of explanations and findings, and builds a research
      that can be replicated and generalized. [todo page 41]
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quantitative approach, the researcher avoids the variation during
      the introduction of the topic since the objective is to what factors and
      variables influence an outcome and not to generate new ideas or
      solutions based on the participants perspective. For example,
      quantitative research can be conducted to understand if the financial
      issues contribute to a divorce. In this case, the variables and factors
      help the research to understand and explain this particular problem. The
      quantitative research introduction should not be written and affected by
      the personal view of the researcher in order to support objectivity.
      [todo page 162]
    </p>
    <h3>2.1 Quantitative Methodologies</h3>
    <p>
      The researcher, despite the fact that has to choose between the
      quantitative, qualitative and mixed research approach, also decides on
      what type of design to choose within these approaches. Research methodologies
      are different kinds of inquiry that provide instructions and direction
      for procedures to be followed in a study. These types of design have
      grown dramatically over the years since the advances made in technology
      and tools to collect and analyze complex data. [todo page 49]
    </p>
    <h4>2.1.1 Field experiments</h4>
    <p>
      Field experiments are conducted in actual environments. To test the effect, one or more factors must be isolated
      and
      changed. Although there are many more variables to take into account, it enables the researcher to witness more
      natural behavior. This method is also frequently used in applied sciences like bioengineering and medicine as well
      as sociology.
      When contrasted to lab tests, field experiments provide a number of advantages. It provides a setting that is more
      similar to nature than a lab. It is appropriate to examine large groups of people since they tend to be more
      representative. On the other side, controlling variables is more complicated, making it very difficult to
      reproduce the same conditions. Furthermore, because it is challenging to manage the environment, unforeseen events
      may occur and have a negative impact on patients and participants. [todo papger page 380]
    </p>
    <h4>2.1.2 Surveys</h4>
    <p>
      A survey is a research method that enables the direct gathering of data from a participant in the study using a
      series of questions arranged in a certain order. It is one of the most popular quantitative techniques because it
      enables the gathering of data on a particular topic by asking questions that capture the attitudes, perceptions,
      and actions of a group of people.
      Surveys have a number of advantages. The high population representativeness and the method's inexpensive cost in
      comparison to other options are two of its most significant advantages. On the other hand, the survey's design and
      the respondents' accuracy of response depend greatly on the validity of the data. [todo paper page 381]
    </p>
    <h4>2.1.3 Correlation study</h4>
    <p>
      In essence, correlational research is an experimental technique used to examine if there is a correlation between
      two or more variables. There is merely an examination of how closely the variables are related; there is no
      manipulation of the variables. A correlational analysis emphasizes two characteristics: the relationship's
      strength and direction. We can quickly quantify observational data by looking at the correlation coefficient. At
      the same time, we can gather a variety of data from numerous domains at once and investigate the relationships
      between those variables. The link between two variables could perhaps be explained by a third variable, hence
      correlation does not imply causality. [todo paper page 381]
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>3. Qualitative Method</h2>
    <p>
      Qualitative research approach is used for understanding the perspective
      of individuals and their experience on a social problem and exploring a
      topic for different nuances. The process of conducting this kind of
      research approach involves data collected from participants in different
      life situations and experience which is represented by the
      interpretation of the researcher. The focus is on the individual meaning
      rather than numbers and statistics. [todo page 41]
    </p>
    <p>
      In a qualitative approach, the problem that the researcher describes can
      be understood by exploring a topic and comprehending new variations
      given by the participants. Qualitative research problem has some
      characteristics: the topic has a lack of previous research and theory
      which may be incorrect, inaccurate or biased; the topic needs to be
      developed further; a quantitative approach is not suitable for this kind
      of problem. In a qualitative approach, the researcher should rely on the
      participant's perspective and may begin the introduction of the problem
      with a personal opinion or experience from the researcher in order to
      focus on the subjective point of view. [todo page 162]
    </p>
    <h3>3.1 Qualitative Methodologies</h3>
    <p>
      In qualitative approaches, the design types became more visible and
      clear during the 1990s. The origins for these approaches come from
      sociology, humanities, and evaluation. There are many methodologies and design types for qualitative research but
      we will focus on observations, ethnography and structured interviews and show their strengths and weaknesses. [
      todo page 50]
    </p>
    <h4>3.1.1 Observation</h4>
    <p>
      Researchers examine a specific phenomena in its natural setting as part
      of a systematic method for gathering information called observation.
      This approach is particularly recommended when a subject is largely
      unknown and it is crucial to fully comprehend a phenomenon while
      preserving the surrounding circumstances. Observation is a useful method
      for gathering information concurrently with the occurrence of the event
      without interfering with it. It is a discrete, highly adaptable strategy
      that is focused on knowledge discovery. In some circumstances, such as
      the study of human and animal behavior, trustworthy data collection is
      the only option. On the other hand, it is a very time-consuming strategy
      that needs advance planning and the researcher's availability to travel
      to the location where the event occurs. Additionally, since the
      researcher is the only one who interprets the data, the method is
      extremely sensitive to the independence of the analysis. [todo paper
      page 376]
    </p>
    <h4>3.1.2 Ethnography</h3>
      <p>
        In ethnography, people are interviewed after being observed in a
        circumstance. In an ethnographic study, the researcher makes an effort
        to understand the scenario being observed from the participants' points
        of view. There are two fundamental elements of ethnography: (i) the
        observation occurs in a natural context, and (ii) researchers must
        comprehend how an event is experienced and processed by members of a
        speech community. The methodologies of observation and ethnography are
        extremely similar. However, when doing an ethnographic study, the
        researcher must adopt a more comprehensive perspective and pay close
        attention to every detail.[todo paper
        page 376]
      </p>
      <p>
        The main benefit of ethnography is that it allows the researcher to gain
        a thorough understanding of the issue under study. However, ethnography
        involves a significant time commitment from the researcher, and because
        the study's findings can be so varied, it can be challenging to draw
        accurate and focused conclusions.
      </p>
      <h4>3.1.3 Structured Interviews</h4>
      <p>
        Structured interviews are a type of assessment tool used to collect and compare interviewee replies. The
        interviewee
        is questioned about prior encounters and/or suggested fictitious settings. All interviewees go through the same
        procedure. High response rates are normal for structured interviews, and the interviewer is present to explain
        the
        question to prevent respondents from misinterpreting it. A systematic interview might take time to prepare,
        though.
        Additionally, even if during the interview new lines of study sound fascinating to pursue, they do not have the
        same
        flexibility in the choice of the responses that are predefined and cannot be changed by the researcher.[todo

    <h2>5 Demo</h2>
    <p>
      In this research, we are conducting a quantitative and qualitative method about the code review process. Code
      review is an important process for software evaluation and improvement nowadays. This process is relatively new
      and some more insight is needed on what developers think about this process by conducting interviews for the
      qualitative part. In order to support this data, we conducted surveys and analyzed the results to provide some
      statistical information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hypothesis of this evaluation is that the code review process is extremely important so we need to prove
      this
      by quantitative data and also get some detailed responses and experiences from professionals related to the
      software industry. We also want to find what tools and methods are more common in the code review process.
      The qualitative session will also provide us with different nuances of what code review process means from the
      participants’ perspective.
    </p>
    <h3>5.1 Audience</h3>
    <p>
      We are focusing our research on professionals in the software industry with different levels of experience,
      from
      junior to senior. This allows us to see how the code review process is perceived by someone who is just
      starting
      in the software world and how it can evolve as a concept during the experience growth. Another important point
      to
      investigate is to relate the importance of the code review process with experience, this shows how this
      process is
      presented to the juniors and if the importance is increased or decreased throughout the years.
    </p>
    <h3>5.2 Questions of Survey</h3>
    <figure>
      <pre>
Q1: Have you ever involved yourself in a code inspection to find common 
vulnerabilities, possible performance issues, possible code improvements 
and improve coding style?

Q2: Has this process helped you improve the code quality?

Q3: What type of code review process have you used?

Q4: If you have a working code, will you use code review for performance
improvement and implement the changes afterwards even if the deadline 
has almost passed?

Q5: Have you ever reviewed the code of your colleagues or vice versa? 
If yes, how effective did you find peer code review?

Q6: Have you ever used automated code review tools? 
(For example: plugins in IDE like ESLint, softwares like
SonarQube)? If yes, how effective did you find automated code review?

Q7: After the code review, some coders find themselves investing 
a few minutes to some hours of additional time, whereas others 
find investing more time than it had taken them to program before the review. 
In scale of percentage how much time have you found yourself investing 
(generally) for modification of your work? Note 100% is the total time
taken for you to come up with a workable solution. 
(Note 100% = total time taken to complete the feature)

Q8: If implementing the code review changes takes more than 
the time needed to implement the new feature, we can say that the code review
process is not effective. How much time do you think code review changes should
take in order to be effective? 
(Note 100% = total time taken to complete the feature)
      </pre>

      <figcaption>
        <strong>Listing 4</strong>: Survey Questions
      </figcaption>
      <p>
        We start the survey with the question that asks the participants if they have ever been part of the code
        review.
        This questions’ objective is to give more insight into the code review process so the participants’ will
        have a
        clear idea of what this process is (Q1). The questions Q2 - Q4 are used to get an idea of how important do
        the
        participants think that code review process is and check if they find it as a critical process or not (Q4).
      </p>
      <p>
        We ask the participants if they have ever used peer review or automated review and see how effective they
        find it
        (Q5 and Q6). These questions are used to compare the two most used code review types and fulfill one of our
        objectives to see which tools and methods are most common in the code review process.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Q7, we ask participants how much time it takes to implement the changes after a code review session. Our
        intention with this question is to indirectly see how important and serious is the code review process
        because if
        it takes a huge amount of time then it means that this process is used for serious purposes not only for
        best
        coding practices and styles.
      </p>
      <p>We included a biased question (Q8) to see if the participants have a clear understanding of the importance
        of
        code review or not. We say that if the code review changes take up a lot of time, then the code review
        process is
        not effective and then we ask them to give a reasonable time range. If they give a high range then we can
        say that
        the code review process is seen as extremely important by the developers.</p>
    </figure>
    <section>
      <h2>Interview</h2>
      We collected qualitative data via interviews. There were 5 interviewees in total. The interview was conducted
      using computer-mediated communication, specifically Zoom. Following are the series of questions asked to our
      interviewees.
      <figure>
        <pre>
  
  Q1 What do you think code review is?
  Q2 Do you believe that code review helps you expand your knowledge?
  Q3 What tool or methods are you familiar with for code review? And which one 
     do you suggest to be used more often?
  Q4 Do you believe code review shortens the development time in the long term?
  Q5 How can we make the code review process more effective?
        </pre>
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Listing 1</strong>: Interview Questions
        </figcaption>
        <p>
          The first question was to know if their understanding of the code review process and our research topic matches.
          All of them had similar answers from which we took keywords and presented them in the word cloud in <a
            href="#wc1">Figure 1</a>.
          Also, everyone agreed that the process helps them expand their skills. For the mid-level developer, it was
          helpful
          because the senior's guidance could make their code quality better. For seniors, it was more about witnessing
          different
          perspectives of developing solutions to the same problem.
        </p>

        For daily use, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> was the most popular tool for reviewing codes, among
        them.
        Whereas, <a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> was suggested as an automated tool that could help in
        the code review process for making it more effective.Some other tools that were mentioned in the interview are in
        <a href="#wc2">Figure 2</a>.
        One interviewee suggested splitting issues into small cards within GitLab would help in reviewing code for other
        developers and make it easier to modify codes. Another interviewee even claimed that
        this automated tool helped shortens the time for the review process.

        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 1</strong>: Code Review Tools
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        We asked if they agree that the code review process shortens the time in the long run even it's time-consuming at the 
        beginning. We got mixed answers on this. Some said that it is or should (if not) already be in the planning of the development. 
        Hence the review is not a factor for time constraints but rather a standard process for quality code. Others agreed with the proposed 
        statement saying that the possible bug is already detected to it save the struggle and time for fixing it. Apart from the tools, 
        pair programming was also advised to be a method that would increase productivity. One interviewee suggested skipping the minor fixes 
        and focusing more on the bigger picture (on security vulnerabilities, memory leakage, readability, etc).
