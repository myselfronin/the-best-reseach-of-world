    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>(Rabinson)</p>
    <p>
      Software integration from kitchens to cars, for the benefit of human civilization, is advancing at a rapid rate.
      One can find software
      in virtually everything used in daily life. The field has stretched itself eminently by changing the way we
      govern, gain education,
      manage health, organize businesses, and so on. This means a huge amount of software has and is being developed
      every day. Along with
      the growth, the complexity of software products has also increased remarkably. The development process has become
      vulnerable to
      missing deadlines, low quality, cost overruns, and so on. Such problems or challenges must be overcome so as to
      prosper the whole
      field of software engineering toward a better future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with the intricacy of software, the optimization of software phenomena or even finding effective ones has
      become a challenging task.
      Nevertheless, it is crucial for companies or organizations to continuously improve their software process in order
      to deliver high-quality
      software within a specified timeframe, budget, and with available resources. A systematic and disciplined approach
      to improving such
      phenomena are needed. Additionally, thousands of research for the sake of improvement are proposed but most of them
      lack or have low quality
      for validation. Such proposals can be evaluated using empirical methods which are best suited as the
      practitioner's perspective is the solid
      acceptance of proposed improvements.
    <p>
      This paper highlights the major empirical methods that can be used to perform an evaluation in software
      engineering. It also features the
      advantages and disadvantages of those methods. Also, we have discussed some of the importance of evaluation in
      software engineering in the
      later section before presenting a demonstration of our findings on performing surveys and interviews as strategies
      for those methods.

    <h2>2. Empirical Software Engineering Evaluation</h2>
    <p>(Rabinson)</p>
    <p>
      One of the pioneers of the SE research community, Robert Glass<a href="#r4">[4]</a> has summarized four methods
      for research in the field of software engineering
      i.e. Scientific Method, Engineering Method, Empirical Method, and Analytical Method. In Scientific Method, the
      the world is observed and a model is
      built on which the research object is evaluated; Engineering Method is about proposing changes to current
      solutions and then evaluating them;
      The analytical method is used when a formal theory is proposed and is compared with empirical observation; in
      Empirical Method a model is evaluated
      empirically.
    <p>
      Although other methods are also necessary for software engineering, the focus of this paper is on
      <strong>Empirical Methods.</strong>
      Software engineering is driven by the professionals involved in software development. In order to
      evaluate the software phenomena, there needs a study on how software practitioners solve software problems ie
      discover their instincts or experience on the topic under discussion. Such phenomena can be processes,
      tools, techniques, policies, practices, and so on, used for developing software. Evaluating such phenomena using
      empirical strategies can be termed Empirical Evaluation in Software Engineering.
    </p>
    <h3>2.1 Empirical Methods</h3>
    <p>(Rabinson)</p>
    <p>
      Qualitative and Quantitative are two main types of research paradigms in empirical studies<a href="#r4">[4]</a>.
      Qualitative is
      concerned with understanding
      the point of view and discovering the notices of the subject. The subject would mean the person participating in
      the empirical studies for
      evaluating an object. These are informed by the qualitative data. On the other hand, Quantitative is concerned
      with comparing two or more
      groups to identify cause-effect relationships. As this is informed by quantitative data, one can perform
      comparison and statistical analysis
      on them. Both quantitative and qualitative research investigations can be implemented on the same topic. However,
      instead of being opposite
      poles, these method represents the different end of a continuum<a href="#r2">[1]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, these two research are differentiated by closed-ended questions and responses, giving us a
      numerical result (quantitative)
      or open-ended questions and responses resulting in answers in words (qualitative) <a href="#r3">[3]</a>. For
      example, when
      evaluating the code review
      process, one can ask about its effectiveness which gives answers on a range scale (i.e numbers). Whereas, others
      can inquire about ways to
      make the code review process more effective. The formal question is a part of quantitative research and the latter
      is for qualitative research.
      But a complete way to see the difference between these two is to look at the basic assumptions, the types of
      research strategies used, and the
      method for conducting those strategies <a href="#r3">[3]</a>. A study can be more quantitative and less
      qualitative in some
      and for others, it is vice-versa.
    </p>
    <h3>2.2 Importance of Evaluation in Research Process</h3>
    <p>(Rabinson)</p>
    <p>
      In order to assess the validity of techniques or methods, evaluation of such a proposal is critical. If proper
      evidence or proof of new or
      improvised conventions is available then the software practitioner would get more confidence in using them. It
      enables us to set standards
      in working with a common problem and drive the software space more scientifically. Rather than a random instinct
      or guess for developing
      solutions, we should use scientifically validated methodologies which leads to a systematic improvement of the
      whole process. The need for
      the usage of empirically evaluated engineering is more essential for us than ever because of the fast-growing and
      challenging software industry.
      Our decision for utilizing certain tools or processes is driven by the evaluation present when such tools or
      processes are proposed. This not
      only contributes to methodical improvement but the overall enhancement of software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the condition of evaluation in research within computer science or software engineering is not
      satisfactory. Additionally, the software
      practitioners themselves are not looking for the validity of the new ways proposed in this research area. 
      According to from critics: "SE research suffers
      from irrelevance. Research outputs have little relevance to software practice."<a href="#r6">[6]</a>.
      Even after a half-century of the existence in this industry, scientific development is still lacking. We would
      like to highlight some results from a research
      published by Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in the year 2009<a href="#r8">[8]</a>. In this research, they
      have
      categorized some random papers and papers specific
      to software engineering, based on the categories introduced by similar research in the year 1995<a href="#r7">[7]</a>.
      They have
      then compared their own
      findings and results from the previous paper. It can be noted that there had been increasing in the reuse of work done by
      other researchers. In 1995 research
      it found that 15% of papers inside design and model did not have an evaluation section. And 67% of sampled papers had
      only one-fifth space dedicated.
      Whereas, research in 2009 found one-third of papers introducing new entities had not presented an evaluation, and 28% of
      them (in empirical and design & model)
      did not have an evaluation section.

      <h2>3 Quantitative Method</h2>
      <p>(Frenkli)</p>
      <p>
        Quantitative research approach uses objective theories and tests them by
        analyzing different variables and the relationship between them. These
        kinds of variables are measured using instruments so numerical data can
        be collected and used to produce statistical results. The researcher in
        this approach builds the research against the bias, eliminates or
        controls new nuances of explanations and findings, and builds a research
        that can be replicated and generalized <a href="#r3">[3](41)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a quantitative approach, the researcher avoids the variation during
        the introduction of the topic since the objective is to what factors and
        variables influence an outcome and not to generate new ideas or
        solutions based on the participants perspective. For example,
        quantitative research can be conducted to understand if the financial
        issues contribute to a divorce. In this case, the variables and factors
        help the research to understand and explain this particular problem. The
        quantitative research introduction should not be written and affected by
        the personal view of the researcher in order to support objectivity <a href="#r3">[3](162)</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>3.1 Quantitative Methodologies</h3>
      <p>(Frenkli)</p>
      <p>
        The researcher, despite the fact that has to choose between the
        quantitative, qualitative and mixed research approach, also decides on
        what type of design to choose within these approaches. Research methodologies
        are different kinds of inquiry that provide instructions and direction
        for procedures to be followed in a study. These types of design have
        grown dramatically over the years since the advances made in technology
        and tools to collect and analyze complex data <a href="#r3">[3](49)</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>3.1.1 Field experiments</h4>
      <p>(Frenkli)</p>
      <p>
        Field experiments are conducted in actual environments. To test the effect, one or more factors must be isolated
        and
        changed. Although there are many more variables to take into account, it enables the researcher to witness more
        natural behavior. This method is also frequently used in applied sciences like bioengineering and medicine as
        well
        as sociology.
        When contrasted to lab tests, field experiments provide a number of advantages. It provides a setting that is
        more
        similar to nature than a lab. It is appropriate to examine large groups of people since they tend to be more
        representative. On the other side, controlling variables is more complicated, making it very difficult to
        reproduce the same conditions. Furthermore, because it is challenging to manage the environment, unforeseen
        events
        may occur and have a negative impact on patients and participants<a href="#r5">[5](380)</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>3.1.2 Surveys</h4>
      <p>(Frenkli)</p>
      <p>
        A survey is a research method that enables the direct gathering of data from a participant in the study using a
        series of questions arranged in a certain order. It is one of the most popular quantitative techniques because
        it
        enables the gathering of data on a particular topic by asking questions that capture the attitudes, perceptions,
        and actions of a group of people.
        Surveys have a number of advantages. The high population representativeness and the method's inexpensive cost in
        comparison to other options are two of its most significant advantages. On the other hand, the survey's design
        and
        the respondents' accuracy of response depend greatly on the validity of the data <a href="#r5">[5](381)</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>3.1.3 Correlation study</h4>
      <p>(Frenkli)</p>
      <p>
        In essence, correlational research is an experimental technique used to examine if there is a correlation
        between
        two or more variables. There is merely an examination of how closely the variables are related; there is no
        manipulation of the variables. A correlational analysis emphasizes two characteristics: the relationship's
        strength and direction. We can quickly quantify observational data by looking at the correlation coefficient. At
        the same time, we can gather a variety of data from numerous domains at once and investigate the relationships
        between those variables. The link between two variables could perhaps be explained by a third variable, hence
        correlation does not imply causality <a href="#r5">[5](381)</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>4. Qualitative Method</h2>
      <p>(Frenkli)</p>
      <p>
        Qualitative research approach is used for understanding the perspective
        of individuals and their experience on a social problem and exploring a
        topic for different nuances. The process of conducting this kind of
        research approach involves data collected from participants in different
        life situations and experience which is represented by the
        interpretation of the researcher. The focus is on the individual meaning
        rather than numbers and statistics <a href="#r3">[3](41)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a qualitative approach, the problem that the researcher describes can
        be understood by exploring a topic and comprehending new variations
        given by the participants. Qualitative research problem has some
        characteristics: the topic has a lack of previous research and theory
        which may be incorrect, inaccurate or biased; the topic needs to be
        developed further; a quantitative approach is not suitable for this kind
        of problem. In a qualitative approach, the researcher should rely on the
        participant's perspective and may begin the introduction of the problem
        with a personal opinion or experience from the researcher in order to
        focus on the subjective point of view <a href="#r3">[3](162)</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>4.1 Qualitative Methodologies</h3>
      <p>(Frenkli)</p>
      <p>
        In qualitative approaches, the design types became more visible and
        clear during the 1990s. The origins for these approaches come from
        sociology, humanities, and evaluation. There are many methodologies and design types for qualitative research
        but
        we will focus on observations, ethnography and structured interviews and show their strengths and weaknesses <a
          href="#r3">[3](50)</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>4.1.1 Observation</h4>
      <p>(Frenkli)</p>
      <p>
        Researchers examine a specific phenomena in its natural setting as part
        of a systematic method for gathering information called observation.
        This approach is particularly recommended when a subject is largely
        unknown and it is crucial to fully comprehend a phenomenon while
        preserving the surrounding circumstances. Observation is a useful method
        for gathering information concurrently with the occurrence of the event
        without interfering with it. It is a discrete, highly adaptable strategy
        that is focused on knowledge discovery. In some circumstances, such as
        the study of human and animal behavior, trustworthy data collection is
        the only option. On the other hand, it is a very time-consuming strategy
        that needs advance planning and the researcher's availability to travel
        to the location where the event occurs. Additionally, since the
        researcher is the only one who interprets the data, the method is
        extremely sensitive to the independence of the analysis <a href="#r5">[5](376)</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>4.1.2 Ethnography</h4>
      <p>(Frenkli)</p>
      <p>
        In ethnography, people are interviewed after being observed in a
        circumstance. In an ethnographic study, the researcher makes an effort
        to understand the scenario being observed from the participants' points
        of view. There are two fundamental elements of ethnography: (i) the
        observation occurs in a natural context, and (ii) researchers must
        comprehend how an event is experienced and processed by members of a
        speech community. The methodologies of observation and ethnography are
        extremely similar. However, when doing an ethnographic study, the
        researcher must adopt a more comprehensive perspective and pay close
        attention to every detail <a href="#r5">[5](376)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main benefit of ethnography is that it allows the researcher to gain
        a thorough understanding of the issue under study. However, ethnography
        involves a significant time commitment from the researcher, and because
        the study's findings can be so varied, it can be challenging to draw
        accurate and focused conclusions.
      </p>
      <h4>4.1.3 Structured Interviews</h4>
      <p>(Frenkli)</p>
      <p>
        Structured interviews are a type of assessment tool used to collect and compare interviewee replies. The
        interviewee
        is questioned about prior encounters and/or suggested fictitious settings. All interviewees go through the same
        procedure. High response rates are normal for structured interviews, and the interviewer is present to explain
        the
        question to prevent respondents from misinterpreting it. A systematic interview might take time to prepare,
        though.
        Additionally, even if during the interview new lines of study sound fascinating to pursue, they do not have the
        same
        flexibility in the choice of the responses that are predefined and cannot be changed by the researcher <a
          href="#r5">[5](377)</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>5 Demo</h2>
      <p>(Rabinson)</p>
      <p>
        In this research, we conducted a quantitative and qualitative method about the code review process. Code
        review is an important process for software evaluation and improvement nowadays. This process is relatively new
        and some more insight is needed on what developers think about this process by conducting interviews for the
        qualitative part. In order to support this data, we conducted surveys and analyzed the results to provide some
        statistical information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hypothesis of this evaluation is that the code review process is extremely important so we need to prove
        this
        by quantitative data and also get some detailed responses and experiences from professionals related to the
        software industry. We also want to find what tools and methods are more common in the code review process.
        The qualitative session will also provide us with different nuances of what code review process means from the
        participants’ perspective.
      </p>
      <h3>5.1 Audience</h3>
      <p>(Rabinson)</p>
      <p>
        We focused our research on professionals in the software industry with different levels of experience,
        from
        junior to senior. This allowed us to see how the code review process is perceived by someone who is just
        starting
        in the software world and how it can evolve as a concept during the experience growth. Another important point
        to
        investigate is to relate the importance of the code review process with experience, this shows how this
        process is
        presented to the juniors and if the importance is increased or decreased throughout the years.
      </p>
      <h3>5.2 Survey</h3>
      <p>(Frenkli)</p>
      <p>
        We used <a href="https://www.limesurvey.org/">LimeSurvey</a> to conduct the survey and collect the quantitative
        data. There
        were 20 participants with different levels of experience. We used <a
          href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a> to analyze the data in order to generate graphs
        and charts.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <pre>
Q1: Have you ever involved yourself in a code inspection to find common 
vulnerabilities, possible performance issues, possible code improvements 
and improve coding style?

Q2: Has this process helped you improve the code quality?

Q3: What type of code review process have you used?

Q4: If you have a working code, will you use code review for performance
improvement and implement the changes afterwards even if the deadline 
has almost passed?

Q5: Have you ever reviewed the code of your colleagues or vice versa? 
If yes, how effective did you find peer code review?

Q6: Have you ever used automated code review tools? 
(For example: plugins in IDE like ESLint, softwares like
SonarQube)? If yes, how effective did you find automated code review?

Q7: After the code review, some coders find themselves investing 
a few minutes to some hours of additional time, whereas others 
find investing more time than it had taken them to program before the review. 
In scale of percentage how much time have you found yourself investing 
(generally) for modification of your work? Note 100% is the total time
taken for you to come up with a workable solution. 
(Note 100% = total time taken to complete the feature)

Q8: If implementing the code review changes takes more than 
the time needed to implement the new feature, we can say that the code review
process is not effective. How much time do you think code review changes should
take in order to be effective? 
(Note 100% = total time taken to complete the feature)

        <figcaption>
          <strong>Listing 1</strong>: Survey Questions
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        We started the survey with the question that asks the participants if they have ever been part of the code
        review.
        This questions’ objective is to give more insight into the code review process so the participants’ will
        have a
        clear idea of what this process is (Q1). The questions Q2 - Q4 were used to get an idea of how important do
        the
        participants think that code review process is and check if they find it as a critical process or not (Q4). We
        found out that every participant has been part of a code review process before or actually being part of it
        frequently. We can see in <a href="#invExp">Figure 1</a>, which is a bar chart that shows
        the involvment in a code review process based on years of experience, that no developer answered
        "Never". This means that
        this process will always be part of software developers or engineers. Only 2
        participants out of 20 answered with "Neutral" in Q2 which asks them if this process has helped you improve the
        code quality. All the other participants answered with "Agree" or "Strongly Agree".
      </p>
      <figure id="invExp">

        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 1</strong>: Involvement with experience
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        In order to check if the
        participants find code review process critical, we asked them Q4 and we found out that nearly half of them don't
        find it as critical. <a href="#importanceCritical">Figure 2</a> shows the answers for 2
        questions: (a) has code review
        been helpful, Q2; (b) is code review critical for you, Q4. We can see that developers find the
        code review process important but not critical since a large number of answers are "Disagree" or "Neutral".
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        We also wanted to investigate which of 3 code review type is used the most. We found out that Peer Review is the
        most commonly used review type. As we can see in <a href="#codeReviewTypes">Figure 3</a>, 89.5% of participants
        have
        used Peer Review. This type is the traditional one
        for reviewing code and it is still the most
        used one. The participants may have little knowledge of other review types thus using the traditional one.
      </p>
      <figure id="codeReviewTypes">

        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 3</strong>: Usage of Review Types

      </figure>
      <p>
        We asked the participants if they have ever used peer review or automated review and see how effective they
        find it
        (Q5 and Q6). These questions were used to compare the two most used code review types and fulfill one of our
        objectives to see which tools and methods are most common in the code review process. By the data shown in
        <a href="#effectivenesCR">Figure 4</a>, we see that the answers are fairly distributed. We can say that
        Peer
        Review is more effective than Automated Review but there are a lot of "No Answer" in Automated Review which
        means
        that the participants don't have any knowledge about this type of review.

        In Q7, we asked participants how much time it takes to implement the changes after a code review session. Our
        intention with this question was to indirectly see how important and serious is the code review process
        because if
        it takes a huge amount of time then it means that this process is used for serious purposes not only for
        best
        coding practices and styles. The answers are distributed in this question as we can see in <a
          href="#timeExpenditure">Figure 5</a>. This means that code review process is taken seriously and there can be
        changes from a code review
        that can take a lot of time compared to the total time needed to implement the feature.

        We included a biased question (Q8) to see if the participants have a clear understanding of the importance
        of
        code review or not. We said that if the code review changes take up a lot of time, then the code review
        process is
        not effective and then we asked them to give a reasonable time range. If they gave a high range then we can
        say that
        the code review process is seen as extremely important by the developers. We can say that the bias had its
        effect
        on the answers as we can see in <a href="#reasonableTimeExpenditure">Figure 6</a>. There are only 5.3% of
        participants
        that answered with >100% of the time. Meanwhile, the code review changes can be really important and the time
        needed to make this changes has no importance.

      <h3>5.3 Interview</h3>
      <p>(Rabinson)</p>
      We collected qualitative data via interviews. There were 5 interviewees in total. The interview was conducted
      using computer-mediated communication, specifically <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. Following are the series
      of questions asked to our
      interviewees.
      <figure>
        <pre>
Q1 What do you think code review is?
Q2 Do you believe that code review helps you expand your knowledge?
Q3 What tool or methods are you familiar with for code review? And which one 
   do you suggest to be used more often?
Q4 Do you believe code review shortens the development time in the long term?
Q5 How can we make the code review process more effective?
        </pre>

      <p>
        The first question was to know if their understanding of the code review process and our research topic
        matches.
        All of them had similar answers from which we took keywords and presented them in the word cloud in <a
          href="#wc1">Figure 7</a>.
        Also, everyone agreed that the process helps them expand their skills. For the mid-level developer, it was
        helpful
        because the senior's guidance could make their code quality better. For seniors, it was more about witnessing
        different
        perspectives of developing solutions to the same problem.

      <p>
        For daily use, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> was the most popular tool for reviewing codes,
        among
        them.
        Whereas, <a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> was suggested as an automated tool that could help
        in
        the code review process for making it more effective.Some other tools that were mentioned in the interview are
        in
        <a href="#wc2">Figure 8</a>.
        One interviewee suggested splitting issues into small cards within GitLab would help in reviewing code for other
        developers and make it easier to modify codes. Another interviewee even claimed that
        this automated tool helped shortens the time for the review process.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        We asked if they agree that the code review process shortens the time in the long run even it's time-consuming
        at the
        beginning. We got mixed answers on this. Some said that it is or should (if not) already be in the planning of
        the development.
        Hence the review is not a factor for time constraints but rather a standard process for quality code. Others
        agreed with the proposed
        statement saying that the possible bug is already detected to it save the struggle and time for fixing it. Apart
        from the tools,
        pair programming was also advised to be a method that would increase productivity. One interviewee suggested
        skipping the minor fixes
        and focusing more on the bigger picture (on security vulnerabilities, memory leakage, readability, etc).
